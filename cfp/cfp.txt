Workshop Overview
-----------------


The 19th Workshop on Adaptive and Reflective Middleware (ARM 2020) will
celebrate 20 years since its first edition, held in conjunction with
the ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware 2000 Conference in Palisades, NY, USA.
This year, we intend to follow on the success of over two decades of this
event, providing researchers with a leading-edge view on the state of the
art in adaptive middleware and the engineering of adaptive and autonomous
distributed systems, as well as fostering an exciting environment for
cooperation among researchers.

Originally, adaptive and reflective middleware was motivated mainly by
resource-constrained devices and mobile computing. Nowadays, the evolution
of adaptive middleware technologies is driven by new classes of large-scale
distributed, pervasive and resilient applications for multi and hybrid cloud,
Internet of Things, smart cities, intelligent transportation, smart grids,
Blockchain networks, resilient supply chains, remote healthcare, among others.

Applying reflective techniques to open-up the implementation of middleware and
related software platforms for interoperability, one-to-many deployment, and
adaptability have proved particularly successful and influential in the past.
However, there are still open challenges mainly related to scalability,
heterogeneity and decentralized management, as well as resilient and autonomous
real-time operations.

Following the trend in recent editions, this year the ARM workshop
will bring together experts involved in designing and reusing adaptive systems
at different layers, including application architecture, OS, virtualization
technology and network. We are also interested in work exploring abstractions
and techniques for adaptation that are complementary to reflection.

 
Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 

* Design and performance of adaptive and reflective middleware platforms; 

* Experiences with adaptive and reflective technologies in specific domains
  (e.g., sensor networks, ubiquitous/pervasive computing, mobile computing,
  smart and connected communities, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things,
  cloud computing, P2P, Systems-of-Systems); 
  
* Cross-layer interactions and adaptation mechanisms, including network, OS,
  VM & device level techniques;
  
* Adaptation and reflection in the presence of heterogeneous execution and
  programming paradigms;
   
* Incorporating non-functional properties into middleware, including real-time,
  fault-tolerance, immutability, persistence, security, trust, privacy and
  so on;
  
* Fundamental developments in the theory and practice of reflection, adaptation
  and control, as it relates to middleware and its interaction with other layers;
  
* Techniques to improve performance and/or scalability of adaptive and
  reflective mechanisms;
  
* Evaluation methodologies for adaptive and reflective middleware; guidelines,
  testbeds and benchmarks;
  
* Approaches to maintain the integrity of adaptive and reflective technologies;
 
* Design and programming abstractions to manage the complexity of adaptive and
  reflective mechanisms;
  
* Software engineering methodologies for the design and development of adaptive
  middleware;
  
* Methods for reasoning, storing and dynamically updating knowledge about the
  services provided by adaptive/reflective middleware;
  
* The role of AI and machine learning in the design of lifelong adaptive
  middleware;
  
* Metrics on properties such as cost-of-adaptation, quality-of-adaptation,
  consistency-of-adaptation, yields.
 



Submission Guidelines
---------------------

All submissions should be made electronically through https://arm2020.hotcrp.com.

Submitted and accepted papers should be no longer than 6 pages in the standard
ACM format for conference proceedings.  Document templates for most popular
document processing tools can be found at:
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

At least one author on each accepted paper must hold a full pre-conference
registration. Papers will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

We will aim to create better outreach for the papers in ARM by selecting the
best papers from the workshop and inviting the authors of those papers to submit
an extended and expanded manuscript (40% new material will be required for the
extended manuscript) towards a publication in the SpringerNature Journal of
Internet Services and Applications.
