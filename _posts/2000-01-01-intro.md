# ARM 2020


## 19th Workshop on Adaptive and Reflexive Middleware

### December 7-11, 2020, Delft, The Netherlands

#### Held in conjunction with <a href="http://2020.middleware-conference.org/">ACM/IFIP Middleware 2020</a>


The Adaptive and Reflective Middleware (ARM) workshop series started together with the ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Middleware Conference, with which it has been co-located every year since this first edition. ARM aims at providing researchers with a leading edge view on the state of the art in reflective and adaptive middleware, and on the challenging problems that remain unsolved. Past editions of the workshop have brought together experts involved in designing and reusing adaptive systems at different system layers, including architectural, OS, virtualization technology, and network layers, as well as in using techniques that are complementary to reflection. The workshop series also seek to provide an exciting environment in which to leverage cooperation among researchers.

This year we will celebrate of the 20th anniversary of the ARM workshop, and as part of the program we will also have invited position papers from key contributors over the years providing a broad perspective on the past, present and future of adaptive systems.
