### Submission


All submissions should be made electronically through: <a href="https://arm2019.hotcrp.com"> https://arm2019.hotcrp.com </a>


Submitted and accepted papers should be no longer than 6 pages in the standard ACM format for conference proceedings.

At least one author on each accepted paper must hold a full pre-conference registration. Papers will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

We will aim to create better outreach for the papers in ARM by selecting the best papers from the workshop and inviting the authors of those papers to submit an extended and expanded manuscript (40% new material will be required for the extended manuscript) towards a publication in the <a href="https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/"> SpringerNature Journal of Internet Services and Applications</a> (pending).
