### Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Design and performance of adaptive and reflective middleware platforms; 
* Experiences with adaptive and reflective technologies in specific domains (e.g., sensor networks, ubiquitous/pervasive computing, mobile computing, smart and connected communities, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, cloud computing, P2P, Systems-of-Systems); 
* Cross-layer interactions and adaptation mechanisms, including network, OS, VM & device level techniques; 
* Adaptation and reflection in the presence of heterogeneous execution and programming paradigms; 
* Incorporating non-functional properties into middleware, including real-time, fault-tolerance, immutability, persistence, security, trust, privacy and so on; 
* Fundamental developments in the theory and practice of reflection, adaptation and control, as it relates to middleware and its interaction with other layers; 
* Techniques to improve performance and/or scalability of adaptive and reflective mechanisms; 
* Evaluation methodologies for adaptive and reflective middleware; guidelines, testbeds and benchmarks; 
* Approaches to maintain the integrity of adaptive and reflective technologies; convergence of adaptation; 
* Design and programming abstractions to manage the complexity of adaptive and reflective mechanisms; 
* Software engineering methodologies for the design and development of adaptive middleware; 
* Methods for reasoning, storing and dynamically updating knowledge about the services provided by adaptive/reflective middleware; 
* The role of AI and machine learning in the design of lifelong adaptive middleware; 
* Metrics on properties such as cost-of-adaptation, quality-of-adaptation, consistency-of-adaptation, yields.
