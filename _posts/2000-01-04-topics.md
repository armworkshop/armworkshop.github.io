### Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Design and performance of adaptive and/or reflective middleware platforms
* Experiences with adaptive and reflective technologies in specific domains (e.g., sensor
networks, ubiquitous/pervasive computing, mobile computing, smart and connected
communities, Internet of Things, cloud/grid computing, P2P, Systems-of-Systems)
* Cross-layer interactions and adaptation mechanisms, including network, OS, VM & device
level techniques
* Adaptation and reflection in the presence of heterogeneous execution and programming
paradigms
* Application of adaptive and reflective middleware techniques to achieve: reconfigurability
and/or adaptability and/or separation of concerns; reuse; and reification of adaptation
techniques and strategies
* Incorporating non-functional properties into middleware, including real-time, fault-
tolerance, immutability, persistence, security, trust, privacy and so on
* Fundamental developments in the theory and practice of reflection, adaptation and control,
as it relates to middleware and its interaction with other layers
* Techniques to improve performance and/or scalability of adaptive and reflective
mechanisms
* Evaluation methodologies for adaptive and reflective middleware; guidelines, testbeds and
benchmarks
* Approaches to maintain the integrity of adaptive and reflective technologies; convergence of
adaptation
* Tool support for adaptive and reflective middleware
* Design and programming abstractions to manage the complexity of adaptive and reflective
mechanisms
* Software engineering methodologies for the design and development of adaptive middleware
* Methods for reasoning, storing and dynamically updating knowledge about the services provided by adaptive/reflective middleware
* The role of techniques such as learning in the design of long-lived adaptive middleware
* Methods for asynchronous, distributed, control, coordination/cooperation among
components providing middleware services
* Metrics on properties such as cost-of-adaptation, quality-of-adaptation, consistency-of-
adaptation, yields
